## Technologies used
The technologies used for the contruction of this site are as follows: 
* [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) - The game itself is written in python and held in the run.py file
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) - Heroku was used to delopy the website as python is a backend language and the game needed a terminal to dsiplay the game
* [GitPod](gitpod.io) - This was used as an IDE, or the Intergrated Development Area, where the HTML, CSS and JavaScritp where all written in the required file types in oder to display the website. 
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - this was used to host the website, so it is viewable to the public.
